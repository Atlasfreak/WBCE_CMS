# WebsiteBaker Community Edition (WBCE)
The [WebsiteBaker Community Edition](http://wbce.org) (WBCE or WebsiteBaker CE) is the further development of the classic content management system (CMS) [WebsiteBaker](http://websitebaker.org), forked off from WebsiteBaker 2.8.3-SP4.

Experienced developers, designers und users will work together to give WebsiteBaker a future - without personal struggles, without hopeless outdated modules and without templates from internet stone age. [WBCE](http://wbce.org) aims to show that WebsiteBaker is not dead yet - and there's a community, where the idea of reaching a common goal is more important than sandbox quarrels. Welcome to [WBCE](http://wbce.org)!

## WBCE Features
`WebsiteBaker Community Edition` is a content management system which aims to combine security, a user friedly interface, search enginge optimization and performance in the best way. As a further development of the approved, but a bit aged CMS WebsiteBaker, `WBCE` has broke free from burdens, but is as compatible as possible to all modules which are at least a little bit maintained.

Furthermore `WBCE` is shipped with the most useful modules and modifications for WebsiteBaker which were developed during the last time. So you have the full power of a tweaked WebsiteBaker without patching core files and installing modules by yourself. `WBCE` shows what WebsiteBaker could be.

### System Requirements
  - PHP 5.3.6 or newer
  - mySQL 5.0 or newer
  - ca. 10 MB space
  - mode_rewrite for `even nicer` URLs
