Resetting the Admin Theme
-----------------------------

As we will experiment quite a lot whith Themes and templates i guess its a good idea to add this little tool.

1. Upload the script to the root of your server.
2. Run it once by calling the url http://yourserver/resettheme.php
3. Delete the file from the server.

Your admin now should be reset to the default WB_Theme/WBCE default Theme.
